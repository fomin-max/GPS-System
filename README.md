# GPS-System
Application written using OOP capabilities (in C ++ and visualized with Qt Creator) for a ground station that collects information (randomly assigned real values) from four satellites in real time and at intervals of 5 seconds determines the position (for example, the arithmetic mean) of the user's GPS receiver.
